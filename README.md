# Nostalgia Inspired Game
Why 3D retro-inspired games are successful today compared to most modern games? 

Brief 

For our assignment, we talked about the diverse types of games we wanted to create for our upcoming project. We talked about what games currently inspire us now and the ones we grew up with and ended up in a discussion about the remakes of old, nostalgic videogames and original indie games that borrow the style and mechanics of those games.  

So, we based the project around nostalgic videogames, specifically 3D platform/adventure games based on the PS1/PS2 and old PC/Mac era. 

Our next step is to figure out what current problems come with 3D retro games. An obvious example is the graphical style of these video games; while some game designers did create interesting and original designs around the console's limitations, these games do show their age compared to most modern games these days. Speaking of limitations, our next question was how did the game developers overcome the graphical barriers when creating a fun and successful videogame? And finally, why are these games so memorable in our day in age?  

These are the main questions that we wanted to research more for our assignment and exploring the old graphical style and mechanics of retro 3D games and improving them in our modern game is our project's goal.  

 

Research Question 

The main research question we decided on is about 

 “Why are 3D retro-inspired games successful today compared to most modern games?”  

We believe there is a significant following for retro games and especially games emulating the old retro style. This helped as our starting off point to begin our research into journal articles and reviews for other videogames.
